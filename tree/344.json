We study parameter inference in large-scale latent variable
models. We first propose a unified treatment of online inference
for latent variable models from a non-canonical exponential
family, and draw explicit links between several previously
proposed frequentist or Bayesian methods. We then propose a
novel inference method for the frequentist estimation of
parameters, that adapts MCMC methods to online inference of
latent variable models with the proper use of local Gibbs
sampling. Then, for latent Dirichlet allocation,we provide an
extensive set of experiments and comparisons with existing work,
where our new approach outperforms all previously proposed
methods. In particular, using Gibbs sampling for latent variable
inference is superior to variational inference in terms of test
log-likelihoods. Moreover, Bayesian inference through
variational methods perform poorly, sometimes leading to worse
fits with latent variables of higher dimensionality.
