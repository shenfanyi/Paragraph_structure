Rank aggregation based on pairwise comparisons over a set of
items has a wide range of applications. Although considerable
research has been devoted to the development of rank aggregation
algorithms, one basic question is how to efficiently collect a
large amount of high-quality pairwise comparisons for the
ranking purpose. Because of the advent of many crowdsourcing
services, a crowd of workers are often hired to conduct pairwise
comparisons with a small monetary reward for each pair they
compare. Since different workers have different levels of
reliability and different pairs have different levels of
ambiguity, it is desirable to wisely allocate the limited budget
for comparisons among the pairs of items and workers so that the
global ranking can be accurately inferred from the comparison
results. To this end, we model the active sampling problem in
