Learning control has become an appealing alternative to the
derivation of control laws based on classic control theory.
However, a major shortcoming of learning control is the lack of
performance guarantees which prevents its application in many
real-world scenarios. As a step towards widespread deployment of
learning control, we provide stability analysis tools for
controllers acting on dynamics represented by Gaussian processes
(GPs). We consider differentiable Markovian control policies and
system dynamics given as (i) the mean of a GP, and (ii) the full
GP distribution. For both cases, we analyze finite and infinite
time horizons. Furthermore, we study the effect of disturbances
on the stability results. Empirical evaluations on simulated
benchmark problems support our theoretical results.
