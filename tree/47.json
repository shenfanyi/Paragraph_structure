We derive two convergence results for a sequential alternating
maximization procedure to approximate the maximizer of random
functionals such as the realized log likelihood in MLE
estimation. We manage to show that the sequence attains the same
deviation properties as shown for the profile M-estimator by
Andresen and Spokoiny (2013), that means a finite sample Wilks
and Fisher theorem. Further under slightly stronger smoothness
constraints on the random functional we can show nearly linear
convergence to the global maximizer if the starting point for
the procedure is well chosen.
