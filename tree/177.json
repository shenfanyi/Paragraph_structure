Latent factor models are the canonical statistical tool for
exploratory analyses of low-dimensional linear structure for a
matrix of $p$ features across $n$ samples. We develop a
structured Bayesian group factor analysis model that extends the
factor model to multiple coupled observation matrices; in the
case of two observations, this reduces to a Bayesian model of
canonical correlation analysis. Here, we carefully define a
structured Bayesian prior that encourages both element-wise and
column-wise shrinkage and leads to desirable behavior on high-
dimensional data. In particular, our model puts a structured
prior on the joint factor loading matrix, regularizing at three
levels, which enables element-wise sparsity and unsupervised
recovery of latent factors corresponding to structured variance
across arbitrary subsets of the observations. In addition, our
structured prior allows for both dense and sparse latent factors
so that covariation among either all features or only a subset
of features can be recovered. We use fast parameter-expanded
expectation-maximization for parameter estimation in this model.
We validate our method on simulated data with substantial
structure. We show results of our method applied to three high-
dimensional data sets, comparing results against a number of
state-of-the-art approaches. These results illustrate useful
properties of our model, including i) recovering sparse signal
in the presence of dense effects; ii) the ability to scale
naturally to large numbers of observations; iii) flexible
observation- and factor-specific regularization to recover
factors with a wide variety of sparsity levels and percentage of
variance explained; and iv) tractable inference that scales to
modern genomic and text data sizes.
