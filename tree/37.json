We study randomized sketching methods for approximately solving
least-squares problem with a general convex constraint. The
quality of a least-squares approximation can be assessed in
different ways: either in terms of the value of the quadratic
objective function (cost approximation), or in terms of some
distance measure between the approximate minimizer and the true
minimizer (solution approximation). Focusing on the latter
criterion, our first main result provides a general lower bound
on any randomized method that sketches both the data matrix and
vector in a least-squares problem; as a surprising consequence,
the most widely used least-squares sketch is sub-optimal for
solution approximation. We then present a new method known as
