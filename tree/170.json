We use a geometric digraph family called class cover catch
digraphs (CCCDs) to tackle the class imbalance problem in
statistical classification. CCCDs provide graph theoretic
solutions to the class cover problem and have been employed in
classification. We assess the classification performance of CCCD
classifiers by extensive Monte Carlo simulations, comparing them
with other classifiers commonly used in the literature. In
particular, we show that CCCD classifiers perform relatively
well when one class is more frequent than the other in a two-
class setting, an example of the
