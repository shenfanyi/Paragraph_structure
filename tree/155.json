This paper develops an efficient computational method for
solving a Gaussian process (GP) regression for large spatial
data sets using a collection of suitably defined local GP
regressions. The conventional local GP approach first partitions
a domain into multiple non-overlapping local regions, and then
fits an independent GP regression for each local region using
the training data belonging to the region. Two key issues with
the local GP are (1) the prediction around the boundary of a
local region is not as accurate as the prediction at interior of
the local region, and (2) two local GP regressions for two
neighboring local regions produce different predictions at the
boundary of the two regions, creating undesirable discontinuity
in the prediction. We address these issues by constraining the
predictions of local GP regressions sharing a common boundary to
satisfy the same boundary constraints, which in turn are
estimated by the data. The boundary constrained local GP
regressions are solved by a finite element method. Our approach
shows competitive performance when compared with several state-
of-the-art methods using two synthetic data sets and three real
data sets.
