Data in the form of pairwise comparisons arises in many domains,
including preference elicitation, sporting competitions, and
peer grading among others. We consider parametric ordinal models
for such pairwise comparison data involving a latent vector $w^*
\in \mathbb{R}^d$ that represents the “qualities” of the $d$
items being compared; this class of models includes the two most
widely used parametric models---the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and
the Thurstone models. Working within a standard minimax
framework, we provide tight upper and lower bounds on the
optimal error in estimating the quality score vector $w^*$ under
this class of models. The bounds depend on the topology of the
comparison graph induced by the subset of pairs being compared,
via the spectrum of the Laplacian of the comparison graph. Thus,
in settings where the subset of pairs may be chosen, our results
provide principled guidelines for making this choice. Finally,
we compare these error rates to those under cardinal measurement
models and show that the error rates in the ordinal and cardinal
settings have identical scalings apart from constant pre-
factors.
