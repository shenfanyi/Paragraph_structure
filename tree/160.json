Given a graph in which a few vertices are deemed interesting a
priori, the vertex nomination task is to order the remaining
vertices into a nomination list such that there is a
concentration of interesting vertices at the top of the list.
Previous work has yielded several approaches to this problem,
with theoretical results in the setting where the graph is drawn
from a stochastic block model (SBM), including a vertex
nomination analogue of the Bayes optimal classifier. In this
paper, we prove that maximum likelihood (ML)-based vertex
nomination is consistent, in the sense that the performance of
the ML-based scheme asymptotically matches that of the Bayes
optimal scheme. We prove theorems of this form both when model
parameters are known and unknown. Additionally, we introduce and
prove consistency of a related, more scalable restricted-focus
ML vertex nomination scheme. Finally, we incorporate vertex and
edge features into ML-based vertex nomination and briefly
explore the empirical effectiveness of this approach.
