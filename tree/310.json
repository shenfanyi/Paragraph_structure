We study distributed learning with the least squares
regularization scheme in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
(RKHS). By a divide-and-conquer approach, the algorithm
partitions a data set into disjoint data subsets, applies the
least squares regularization scheme to each data subset to
produce an output function, and then takes an average of the
individual output functions as a final global estimator or
predictor. We show with error bounds and learning rates in
expectation in both the $L^2$-metric and RKHS-metric that the
global output function of this distributed learning is a good
approximation to the algorithm processing the whole data in one
single machine. Our derived learning rates in expectation are
optimal and stated in a general setting without any
eigenfunction assumption. The analysis is achieved by a novel
second order decomposition of operator differences in our
integral operator approach. Even for the classical least squares
regularization scheme in the RKHS associated with a general
kernel, we give the best learning rate in expectation in the
literature.
