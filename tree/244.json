POMDPs.jl is an open-source framework for solving Markov
decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs
(POMDPs). POMDPs.jl allows users to specify sequential decision
making problems with minimal effort without sacrificing the
expressive nature of POMDPs, making this framework viable for
both educational and research purposes. It is written in the
Julia language to allow flexible prototyping and large-scale
computation that leverages the high-performance nature of the
language. The associated JuliaPOMDP community also provides a
number of state-of-the-art MDP and POMDP solvers and a rich
library of support tools to help with implementing new solvers
and evaluating the solution results. The most recent version of
POMDPs.jl, the related packages, and documentation can be found
