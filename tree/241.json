Java Statistical Analysis Tool (JSAT) is a Machine Learning
library written in pure Java. It works to fill a void in the
Java ecosystem for a general purpose library that is relatively
high performance and flexible, which is not adequately fulfilled
by Weka (Hall et al., 2009) and Java-ML (Abeel et al., 2009).
Almost all of the algorithms are independently implemented using
an Object- Oriented framework. JSAT is made available under the
GNU GPL license here:
