Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible distributions over
functions that enable high-level assumptions about unknown
functions to be encoded in a parsimonious, flexible and general
way. Although elegant, the application of GPs is limited by
computational and analytical intractabilities that arise when
data are sufficiently numerous or when employing non-Gaussian
models. Consequently, a wealth of GP approximation schemes have
been developed over the last 15 years to address these key
limitations. Many of these schemes employ a small set of pseudo
data points to summarise the actual data. In this paper we
develop a new pseudo-point approximation framework using Power
Expectation Propagation (Power EP) that unifies a large number
of these pseudo-point approximations. Unlike much of the
previous venerable work in this area, the new framework is built
on standard methods for approximate inference (variational free-
energy, EP and Power EP methods) rather than employing
approximations to the probabilistic generative model itself. In
this way all of the approximation is performed at `inference
time' rather than at `modelling time', resolving awkward
philosophical and empirical questions that trouble previous
approaches. Crucially, we demonstrate that the new framework
includes new pseudo-point approximation methods that outperform
current approaches on regression and classification tasks.
