We present online Bayesian Passive-Aggressive (BayesPA)
learning, a generic online learning framework for hierarchical
Bayesian models with max-margin posterior regularization. We
show that BayesPA subsumes the standard online Passive-
Aggressive (PA) learning and extends naturally to incorporate
latent variables for both parametric and nonparametric Bayesian
inference, therefore providing great flexibility for explorative
analysis. As an important example, we apply BayesPA to topic
modeling and derive efficient online learning algorithms for
max-margin topic models. We further develop nonparametric
BayesPA topic models to infer the unknown number of topics in an
online manner. Experimental results on 20newsgroups and a large
Wikipedia multi-label dataset (with 1.1 millions of training
documents and 0.9 million of unique terms in the vocabulary)
show that our approaches significantly improve time efficiency
while achieving comparable accuracy with the corresponding batch
algorithms.
