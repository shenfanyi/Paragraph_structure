Adjusted for chance measures are widely used to compare
partitions/clusterings of the same data set. In particular, the
Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) based on pair-counting, and the
Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) based on Shannon information
theory are very popular in the clustering community. Nonetheless
it is an open problem as to what are the best application
scenarios for each measure and guidelines in the literature for
their usage are sparse, with the result that users often resort
to using both. Generalized Information Theoretic (IT) measures
based on the Tsallis entropy have been shown to link pair-
counting and Shannon IT measures. In this paper, we aim to
bridge the gap between adjustment of measures based on pair-
counting and measures based on information theory. We solve the
key technical challenge of analytically computing the expected
value and variance of generalized IT measures. This allows us to
propose adjustments of generalized IT measures, which reduce to
well known adjusted clustering comparison measures as special
cases. Using the theory of generalized IT measures, we are able
to propose the following guidelines for using ARI and AMI as
external validation indices: ARI should be used when the
reference clustering has large equal sized clusters; AMI should
be used when the reference clustering is unbalanced and there
exist small clusters.
