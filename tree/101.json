We consider the problem of improving the efficiency of
randomized Fourier feature maps to accelerate training and
testing speed of kernel methods on large data sets. These
approximate feature maps arise as Monte Carlo approximations to
integral representations of shift-invariant kernel functions
(e.g., Gaussian kernel). In this paper, we propose to use
