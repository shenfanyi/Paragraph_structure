In statistical relational learning, knowledge graph completion
deals with automatically understanding the structure of large
knowledge graphs---labeled directed graphs---and predicting
missing relationships---labeled edges. State-of-the-art
embedding models propose different trade-offs between modeling
expressiveness, and time and space complexity. We reconcile both
expressiveness and complexity through the use of complex-valued
embeddings and explore the link between such complex-valued
embeddings and unitary diagonalization. We corroborate our
approach theoretically and show that
