Inference methods are often formulated as variational
approximations: these approxima- tions allow easy evaluation of
statistics by marginalization or linear response, but these
estimates can be inconsistent. We show that by introducing
constraints on covariance, one can ensure consistency of linear
response with the variational parameters, and in so doing
inference of marginal probability distributions is improved. For
the Bethe approximation and its generalizations, improvements
are achieved with simple choices of the constraints. The
approximations are presented as variational frameworks;
iterative procedures related to message passing are provided for
finding the minima.
