We present a general framework for graph clustering and bi-
clustering where we are given a general observation (called a
label) between each pair of nodes. This framework allows a rich
encoding of various types of pairwise interactions between
nodes. We propose a new tractable and robust approach to this
problem based on convex optimization and maximum likelihood
estimators. We analyze our algorithms under a general
statistical model extending the planted partition and stochastic
block models. Both sufficient and necessary conditions are
provided for successful recovery of the underlying clusters. Our
theoretical results subsume many existing graph clustering
results for a wide range of settings, including planted
partition, weighted clustering, submatrix localization and
partially observed graphs. Furthermore, our results are
applicable to novel settings including time-varying graphs,
providing new insights to solutions of these problems. We
provide empirical results on both synthetic and real data that
corroborate with our theoretical findings.
