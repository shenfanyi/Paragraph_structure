The proliferation of online communities has attracted much
attention to modelling user behaviour in terms of social
interaction, language adoption and contribution activity.
Nevertheless, when applied to large-scale and cross-platform
behavioural data, existing approaches generally suffer from
expressiveness, scalability and generality issues. This paper
proposes trans-dimensional von Mises-Fisher (TvMF) mixture
models for $\mathcal{L}_{2}$ normalised behavioural data, which
encapsulate: (1) a Bayesian framework for vMF mixtures that
enables prior knowledge and information sharing among clusters,
(2) an extended version of reversible jump MCMC algorithm that
allows adaptive changes in the number of clusters for vMF
mixtures when the model parameters are updated, and (3) an
online TvMF mixture model that accommodates the dynamics of
clusters for time-varying user behavioural data. We develop
efficient collapsed Gibbs sampling techniques for posterior
inference, which facilitates parallelism for parameter updates.
Empirical results on simulated and real-world data show that the
proposed TvMF mixture models can discover more interpretable and
intuitive clusters than other widely-used models, such as
k-means, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), Dirichlet
process Gaussian mixture models (DP-GMM), and dynamic topic
models (DTM). We further evaluate the performance of proposed
models in real-world applications, such as the churn prediction
task, that shows the usefulness of the features generated.
