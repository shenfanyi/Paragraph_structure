GPflow is a Gaussian process library that uses TensorFlow for
its core computations and Python for its front end. The
distinguishing features of GPflow are that it uses variational
inference as the primary approximation method, provides concise
code through the use of automatic differentiation, has been
engineered with a particular emphasis on software testing and is
able to exploit GPU hardware.
