We introduce a novel approach for estimating Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) parameters from collapsed Gibbs samples (CGS),
by leveraging the full conditional distributions over the latent
variable assignments to efficiently average over multiple
samples, for little more computational cost than drawing a
single additional collapsed Gibbs sample. Our approach can be
understood as adapting the soft clustering methodology of
Collapsed Variational Bayes (CVB0) to CGS parameter estimation,
in order to get the best of both techniques. Our estimators can
straightforwardly be applied to the output of any existing
implementation of CGS, including modern accelerated variants. We
perform extensive empirical comparisons of our estimators with
those of standard collapsed inference algorithms on real-world
data for both unsupervised LDA and Prior-LDA, a supervised
variant of LDA for multi-label classification. Our results show
a consistent advantage of our approach over traditional CGS
under all experimental conditions, and over CVB0 inference in
the majority of conditions. More broadly, our results highlight
the importance of averaging over multiple samples in LDA
parameter estimation, and the use of efficient computational
techniques to do so.
