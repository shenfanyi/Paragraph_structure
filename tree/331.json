We present an approach based on feed-forward neural networks for
learning the distribution over textual documents. This approach
is inspired by the Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator
(NADE) model which has been shown to be a good estimator of the
distribution over discrete-valued high-dimensional vectors. In
this paper, we present how NADE can successfully be adapted to
textual data, retaining the property that sampling or computing
the probability of an observation can be done exactly and
efficiently. The approach can also be used to learn deep
representations of documents that are competitive to those
learned by alternative topic modeling approaches. Finally, we
describe how the approach can be combined with a regular neural
network N-gram model and substantially improve its performance,
by making its learned representation sensitive to the larger,
document-level context.
