We study the design of interactive clustering algorithms. The
user supervision that we consider is in the form of cluster
split/merge requests; such feedback is easy for users to provide
because it only requires a high-level understanding of the
clusters. Our algorithms start with any initial clustering and
only make local changes in each step; both are desirable
properties in many applications. Local changes are desirable
because in practice edits of other parts of the clustering are
considered churn - changes that are perceived as quality-neutral
or quality-negative. We show that in this framework we can still
design provably correct algorithms given that our data satisfies
natural separability properties. We also show that our framework
works well in practice.
