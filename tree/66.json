Variable selection is popular in high-dimensional data analysis
to identify the truly informative variables. Many variable
selection methods have been developed under various model
assumptions. Whereas success has been widely reported in
literature, their performances largely depend on validity of the
assumed models, such as the linear or additive models. This
article introduces a model-free variable selection method via
learning the gradient functions. The idea is based on the
equivalence between whether a variable is informative and
whether its corresponding gradient function is substantially
non-zero. The proposed variable selection method is then
formulated in a framework of learning gradients in a flexible
reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The key advantage of the
proposed method is that it requires no explicit model assumption
and allows for general variable effects. Its asymptotic
estimation and selection consistencies are studied, which
establish the convergence rate of the estimated sparse gradients
and assure that the truly informative variables are correctly
identified in probability. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is also supported by a variety of simulated examples and
two real-life examples.
