We study neural networks whose only non-linear components are
multipliers, to test a new training rule in a context where the
precise representation of data is paramount. These networks are
challenged to discover the rules of matrix multiplication, given
many examples. By limiting the number of multipliers, the
network is forced to discover the Strassen multiplication rules.
This is the mathematical equivalent of finding low rank
decompositions of the $n\times n$ matrix multiplication tensor,
$M_n$. We train these networks with the conservative learning
rule, which makes minimal changes to the weights so as to give
the correct output for each input at the time the input-output
pair is received. Conservative learning needs a few thousand
examples to find the rank 7 decomposition of $M_2$, and $10^5$
for the rank 23 decomposition of $M_3$ (the lowest known). High
precision is critical, especially for $M_3$, to discriminate
between true decompositions and â€œborder approximations".
