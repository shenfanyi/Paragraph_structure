This paper is concerned with the problem of finding a sparse
graph capturing the conditional dependence between the entries
of a Gaussian random vector, where the only available
information is a sample correlation matrix. A popular approach
to address this problem is the graphical lasso technique, which
employs a sparsity-promoting regularization term. This paper
derives a simple condition under which the computationally-
expensive graphical lasso behaves the same as the simple
heuristic method of thresholding. This condition depends only on
the solution of graphical lasso and makes no direct use of the
sample correlation matrix or the regularization coefficient. It
is proved that this condition is always satisfied if the
solution of graphical lasso is close to its first-order Taylor
approximation or equivalently the regularization term is
relatively large. This condition is tested on several random
problems, and it is shown that graphical lasso and the
thresholding method lead to highly similar results in the case
where a sparse graph is sought. We also conduct two case studies
on brain connectivity networks of twenty subjects based on fMRI
data and the topology identification of electrical circuits to
support the findings of this work on the similarity of graphical
lasso and thresholding.
