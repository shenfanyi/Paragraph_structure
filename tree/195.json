Inference and learning of graphical models are both well-studied
problems in statistics and machine learning that have found many
applications in science and engineering. However, exact
inference is intractable in general graphical models, which
suggests the problem of seeking the best approximation to a
collection of random variables within some tractable family of
graphical models. In this paper, we focus on the class of planar
Ising models, for which exact inference is tractable using
techniques of statistical physics. Based on these techniques and
recent methods for planarity testing and planar embedding, we
propose a greedy algorithm for learning the best planar Ising
model to approximate an arbitrary collection of binary random
variables (possibly from sample data). Given the set of all
pairwise correlations among variables, we select a planar graph
and optimal planar Ising model defined on this graph to best
approximate that set of correlations. We demonstrate our method
in simulations and for two applications: modeling senate voting
records and identifying geo-chemical depth trends from Mars
rover data.
