The discovery of causal relationships from purely observational
data is a fundamental problem in science. The most elementary
form of such a causal discovery problem is to decide whether $X$
causes $Y$ or, alternatively, $Y$ causes $X$, given joint
observations of two variables $X,Y$. An example is to decide
whether altitude causes temperature, or vice versa, given only
joint measurements of both variables. Even under the simplifying
assumptions of no confounding, no feedback loops, and no
selection bias, such bivariate causal discovery problems are
challenging. Nevertheless, several approaches for addressing
those problems have been proposed in recent years. We review two
families of such methods: methods based on Additive Noise Models
(ANMs) and Information Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI). We
present the benchmark
