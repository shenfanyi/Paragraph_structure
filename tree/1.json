This paper considers the problem of subspace clustering under
noise. Specifically, we study the behavior of Sparse Subspace
Clustering (SSC) when either adversarial or random noise is
added to the unlabeled input data points, which are assumed to
be in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. We show that a
modified version of SSC is
