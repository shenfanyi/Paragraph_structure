We introduce Refinery, an open source platform for exploring
large text document collections with topic models. Refinery is a
standalone web application driven by a graphical interface, so
it is usable by those without machine learning or programming
expertise. Users can interactively organize articles by topic
and also refine this organization with phrase-level analysis.
Under the hood, we train Bayesian nonparametric topic models
that can adapt model complexity to the provided data with
scalable learning algorithms.
