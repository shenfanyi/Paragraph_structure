Multi-armed bandit problem is an important optimization game
that requires an exploration-exploitation tradeoff to achieve
optimal total reward. Motivated from industrial applications
such as online advertising and clinical research, we consider a
setting where the rewards of bandit machines are associated with
covariates, and the accurate estimation of the corresponding
mean reward functions plays an important role in the performance
of allocation rules. Under a flexible problem setup, we
establish asymptotic strong consistency and perform a finite-
time regret analysis for a sequential randomized allocation
strategy based on kernel estimation. In addition, since many
nonparametric and parametric methods in supervised learning may
be applied to estimating the mean reward functions but guidance
on how to choose among them is generally unavailable, we propose
a model combining allocation strategy for adaptive performance.
Simulations and a real data evaluation are conducted to
illustrate the performance of the proposed allocation strategy.
