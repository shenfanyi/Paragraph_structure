This paper considers the problem of matrix completion when the
observed entries are noisy and contain outliers. It begins with
introducing a new optimization criterion for which the recovered
matrix is defined as its solution. This criterion uses the
celebrated Huber function from the robust statistics literature
to downweigh the effects of outliers. A practical algorithm is
developed to solve the optimization involved. This algorithm is
fast, straightforward to implement, and monotonic convergent.
Furthermore, the proposed methodology is theoretically shown to
be stable in a well defined sense. Its promising empirical
performance is demonstrated via a sequence of simulation
experiments, including image inpainting.
