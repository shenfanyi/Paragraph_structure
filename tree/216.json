Comparing with the standard $L_2$-norm support vector machine
(SVM), the $L_1$-norm SVM enjoys the nice property of
simultaneously preforming classification and feature selection.
In this paper, we investigate the statistical performance of
$L_1$-norm SVM in ultra-high dimension, where the number of
features $p$ grows at an exponential rate of the sample size
$n$. Different from existing theory for SVM which has been
mainly focused on the generalization error rates and empirical
risk, we study the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients of
$L_1$-norm SVM. Our analysis reveals that the $L_1$-norm SVM
coefficients achieve near oracle rate, that is, with high
probability, the $L_2$ error bound of the estimated $L_1$-norm
SVM coefficients is of order $O_p(\sqrt{q\log p/n})$, where $q$
is the number of features with nonzero coefficients.
Furthermore, we show that if the $L_1$-norm SVM is used as an
initial value for a recently proposed algorithm for solving non-
convex penalized SVM (Zhang et al., 2016b), then in two
iterative steps it is guaranteed to produce an estimator that
possesses the oracle property in ultra-high dimension, which in
particular implies that with probability approaching one the
zero coefficients are estimated as exactly zero. Simulation
studies demonstrate the fine performance of $L_1$-norm SVM as a
sparse classifier and its effectiveness to be utilized to solve
non-convex penalized SVM problems in high dimension.
