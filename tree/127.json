Analyzing multi-layered graphical models provides insight into
understanding the conditional relationships among nodes within
layers after adjusting for and quantifying the effects of nodes
from other layers. We obtain the penalized maximum likelihood
estimator for Gaussian multi-layered graphical models, based on
a computational approach involving screening of variables,
iterative estimation of the directed edges between layers and
undirected edges within layers and a final refitting and
stability selection step that provides improved performance in
finite sample settings. We establish the consistency of the
estimator in a high-dimensional setting. To obtain this result,
we develop a strategy that leverages the biconvexity of the
likelihood function to ensure convergence of the developed
iterative algorithm to a stationary point, as well as careful
uniform error control of the estimates over iterations. The
performance of the maximum likelihood estimator is illustrated
on synthetic data.
