The robust improper maximum likelihood estimator (RIMLE) is a
new method for robust multivariate clustering finding
approximately Gaussian clusters. It maximizes a pseudo-
likelihood defined by adding a component with improper constant
density for accommodating outliers to a Gaussian mixture. A
special case of the RIMLE is MLE for multivariate finite
Gaussian mixture models. In this paper we treat existence,
consistency, and breakdown theory for the RIMLE comprehensively.
RIMLE's existence is proved under non-smooth covariance matrix
constraints. It is shown that these can be implemented via a
computationally feasible Expectation-Conditional Maximization
algorithm.
