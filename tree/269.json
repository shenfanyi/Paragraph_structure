We aim at recovering the weighted adjacency matrix $\mathsf{W}$ of an
undirected graph from a perturbed version of its eigenspaces.
This situation arises for instance when working with stationary
signals on graphs or Markov chains observed at random times. Our
approach relies on minimizing a cost function based on the
Frobenius norm of the commutator $\mathsf{A}
\mathsf{B}-\mathsf{B} \mathsf{A}$ between symmetric matrices
$\mathsf{A}$ and $\mathsf{B}$. We describe a particular
framework in which we have access to an estimation of the
eigenspaces and provide support selection procedures from
theoretical and practical points of view. In the Erdős-Rényi
model on $N$ vertices with no self-loops, we show that
identifiability (i.e., the ability to reconstruct $\mathsf{W}$
from the knowledge of its eigenspaces) follows a sharp phase
transition on the expected number of edges with threshold
function $N\log N/2$. Simulated and real life numerical
experiments assert our methodology.
