Our paper deals with inferring simulator-based statistical
models given some observed data. A simulator-based model is a
parametrized mechanism which specifies how data are generated.
It is thus also referred to as generative model. We assume that
only a finite number of parameters are of interest and allow the
generative process to be very general; it may be a noisy
nonlinear dynamical system with an unrestricted number of hidden
variables. This weak assumption is useful for devising realistic
models but it renders statistical inference very difficult. The
main challenge is the intractability of the likelihood function.
Several likelihood-free inference methods have been proposed
which share the basic idea of identifying the parameters by
finding values for which the discrepancy between simulated and
observed data is small. A major obstacle to using these methods
is their computational cost. The cost is largely due to the need
to repeatedly simulate data sets and the lack of knowledge about
how the parameters affect the discrepancy. We propose a strategy
which combines probabilistic modeling of the discrepancy with
optimization to facilitate likelihood-free inference. The
strategy is implemented using Bayesian optimization and is shown
to accelerate the inference through a reduction in the number of
required simulations by several orders of magnitude.
