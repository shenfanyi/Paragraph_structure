We consider the optimization of a quadratic objective function
whose gradients are only accessible through a stochastic oracle
that returns the gradient at any given point plus a zero-mean
finite variance random error. We present the first algorithm
that achieves jointly the optimal prediction error rates for
least-squares regression, both in terms of forgetting the
initial conditions in $O(1/n^2)$, and in terms of dependence on
the noise and dimension $d$ of the problem, as $O(d/n)$. Our new
algorithm is based on averaged accelerated regularized gradient
descent, and may also be analyzed through finer assumptions on
initial conditions and the Hessian matrix, leading to dimension-
free quantities that may still be small in some distances while
the “optimal” terms above are large. In order to characterize
the tightness of these new bounds, we consider an application to
non-parametric regression and use the known lower bounds on the
statistical performance (without computational limits), which
happen to match our bounds obtained from a single pass on the
data and thus show optimality of our algorithm in a wide variety
of particular trade-offs between bias and variance.
