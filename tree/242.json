Model selection consistency in the high--dimensional regression
setting can be achieved only if strong assumptions are
fulfilled. We therefore suggest to pursue a different goal,
which we call a minimal class of models. The minimal class of
models includes models that are similar in their prediction
accuracy but not necessarily in their elements. We suggest a
random search algorithm to reveal candidate models. The
algorithm implements simulated annealing while using a score for
each predictor that we suggest to derive using a combination of
the lasso and the elastic net. The utility of using a minimal
class of models is demonstrated in the analysis of two data
sets.
