Many data mining and statistical machine learning algorithms
have been developed to select a subset of covariates to
associate with a response variable. Spurious discoveries can
easily arise in high-dimensional data analysis due to enormous
possibilities of such selections. How can we know statistically
our discoveries better than those by chance? In this paper, we
define a measure of goodness of spurious fit, which shows how
good a response variable can be fitted by an optimally selected
subset of covariates under the null model, and propose a simple
and effective LAMM algorithm to compute it. It coincides with
the maximum spurious correlation for linear models and can be
regarded as a generalized maximum spurious correlation. We
derive the asymptotic distribution of such goodness of spurious
fit for generalized linear models and $L_1$ regression. Such an
asymptotic distribution depends on the sample size, ambient
dimension, the number of variables used in the fit, and the
covariance information. It can be consistently estimated by
multiplier bootstrapping and used as a benchmark to guard
against spurious discoveries. It can also be applied to model
selection, which considers only candidate models with goodness
of fits better than those by spurious fits. The theory and
method are convincingly illustrated by simulated examples and an
application to the binary outcomes from German Neuroblastoma
Trials.
