Obtaining a non-parametric expression for an interventional
distribution is one of the most fundamental tasks in causal
inference. Such an expression can be obtained for an
identifiable causal effect by an algorithm or by manual
application of do-calculus. Often we are left with a complicated
expression which can lead to biased or inefficient estimates
when missing data or measurement errors are involved. We present
an automatic simplification algorithm that seeks to eliminate
symbolically unnecessary variables from these expressions by
taking advantage of the structure of the underlying graphical
model. Our method is applicable to all causal effect formulas
and is readily available in the R package causaleffect.
