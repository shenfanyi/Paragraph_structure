We study minimax rates for denoising simultaneously sparse and
low rank matrices in high dimensions. We show that an iterative
thresholding algorithm achieves (near) optimal rates adaptively
under mild conditions for a large class of loss functions.
Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets also demonstrate the
competitive performance of the proposed method.
