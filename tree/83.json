This work analyzes centered Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)
and centered Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs), where centering is
done by subtracting offset values from visible and hidden
variables. We show analytically that (i) centered and normal
Boltzmann Machines (BMs) and thus RBMs and DBMs are different
parameterizations of the same model class, such that any normal
BM/RBM/DBM can be transformed to an equivalent centered
BM/RBM/DBM and
