Information about intrinsic dimension is crucial to perform
dimensionality reduction, compress information, design efficient
algorithms, and do statistical adaptation. In this paper we
propose an estimator for the intrinsic dimension of a data set.
The estimator is based on binary neighbourhood information about
the observations in the form of two adjacency matrices, and does
not require any explicit distance information. The underlying
graph is modelled according to a subset of a specific random
connection model, sometimes referred to as the Poisson blob
model. Computationally the estimator scales like $n\log n$, and
we specify its asymptotic distribution and rate of convergence.
A simulation study on both real and simulated data shows that
our approach compares favourably with some competing methods
from the literature, including approaches that rely on distance
information.
