This article describes the Multiagent Decision Process (MADP)
Toolbox, a software library to support planning and learning for
intelligent agents and multiagent systems in uncertain
environments. Key features are that it supports partially
observable environments and stochastic transition models; has
unified support for single- and multiagent systems; provides a
large number of models for decision-theoretic decision making,
including one-shot and sequential decision making under various
assumptions of observability and cooperation, such as Dec-POMDPs
and POSGs; provides tools and parsers to quickly prototype new
problems; provides an extensive range of planning and learning
algorithms for single- and multiagent systems; is released under
the GNU GPL v3 license; and is written in C++ and designed to be
extensible via the object-oriented paradigm.
