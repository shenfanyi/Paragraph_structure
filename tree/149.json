Stable random variables are motivated by the central limit
theorem for densities with (potentially) unbounded variance and
can be thought of as natural generalizations of the Gaussian
distribution to skewed and heavy-tailed phenomenon. In this
paper, we introduce $\alpha$-stable graphical ($\alpha$-SG)
models, a class of multivariate stable densities that can also
be represented as Bayesian networks whose edges encode linear
dependencies between random variables. One major hurdle to the
extensive use of stable distributions is the lack of a closed-
form analytical expression for their densities. This makes
penalized maximum-likelihood based learning computationally
demanding. We establish theoretically that the
