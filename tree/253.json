Hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) are latent variable models
which allow latent state persistence and can be viewed as a
generalization of the popular hidden Markov models (HMMs). In
this paper, we introduce a novel spectral algorithm to perform
inference in HSMMs. Unlike expectation maximization (EM), our
approach correctly estimates the probability of given
observation sequence based on a set of training sequences. Our
approach is based on estimating moments from the sample, whose
number of dimensions depends only logarithmically on the maximum
length of the hidden state persistence. Moreover, the algorithm
requires only a few matrix inversions and is therefore
computationally efficient. Empirical evaluations on synthetic
and real data demonstrate the advantage of the algorithm over EM
in terms of speed and accuracy, especially for large data sets.
