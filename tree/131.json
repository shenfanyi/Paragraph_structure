A general asymptotic framework is developed for studying
consistency properties of principal component analysis (PCA).
Our framework includes several previously studied domains of
asymptotics as special cases and allows one to investigate
interesting connections and transitions among the various
domains. More importantly, it enables us to investigate
asymptotic scenarios that have not been considered before, and
gain new insights into the consistency, subspace consistency and
strong inconsistency regions of PCA and the boundaries among
them. We also establish the corresponding convergence rate
within each region. Under general spike covariance models, the
dimension (or number of variables) discourages the consistency
of PCA, while the sample size and spike information (the
relative size of the population eigenvalues) encourage PCA
consistency. Our framework nicely illustrates the relationship
among these three types of information in terms of dimension,
sample size and spike size, and rigorously characterizes how
their relationships affect PCA consistency.
