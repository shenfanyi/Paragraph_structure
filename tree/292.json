The problem of testing mutual independence between many random
vectors is addressed. The closely related problem of testing
serial independence of a multivariate stationary sequence is
also considered. The MÃ¶bius transformation of characteristic
functions is used to characterize independence. A generalization
to $p$ vectors of distance covariance and Hilbert-Schmidt
independence criterion ($HSIC$) tests with the translation
invariant kernel of a stable probability distribution is
proposed. Both test statistics can be expressed in a simple form
as a sum over all elements of a componentwise product of $p$
doubly-centered matrices. It is shown that an $HSIC$ statistic
with sufficiently small scale parameters is equivalent to a
distance covariance statistic. Consistency and weak convergence
of both types of statistics are established. Approximation of
$p$-values is made by randomization tests without recomputing
interpoint distances for each randomized sample. The dependogram
is adapted to the proposed tests for the graphical
identification of sources of dependencies. Empirical rejection
rates obtained through extensive simulations confirm both the
applicability of the testing procedures in small samples and the
high level of competitiveness in terms of power. Applications to
meteorological and financial data provide some interesting
interpretations of dependencies revealed by dependograms.
