The class of linkage-based algorithms is perhaps the most
popular class of hierarchical algorithms. We identify two
properties of hierarchical algorithms, and prove that linkage-
based algorithms are the only ones that satisfy both of these
properties. Our characterization clearly delineates the
difference between linkage-based algorithms and other
hierarchical methods. We formulate an intuitive notion of
locality of a hierarchical algorithm that distinguishes between
linkage-based and
