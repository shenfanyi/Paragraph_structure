Given a high-dimensional data set, we often wish to find the
strongest relationships within it. A common strategy is to
evaluate a measure of dependence on every variable pair and
retain the highest-scoring pairs for follow-up. This strategy
works well if the statistic used (a) has good power to detect
non-trivial relationships, and (b) is
