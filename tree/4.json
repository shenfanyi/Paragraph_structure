Matrix approximation is a common tool in recommendation systems,
text mining, and computer vision. A prevalent assumption in
constructing matrix approximations is that the partially
observed matrix is low-rank. In this paper, we propose, analyze,
and experiment with two procedures, one parallel and the other
global, for constructing
