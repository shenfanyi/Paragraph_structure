We propose a novel approach to Bayesian analysis that is
provably robust to outliers in the data and often has
computational advantages over standard methods. Our technique is
based on splitting the data into non-overlapping subgroups,
evaluating the posterior distribution given each independent
subgroup, and then combining the resulting measures. The main
novelty of our approach is the proposed aggregation step, which
is based on the evaluation of a median in the space of
probability measures equipped with a suitable collection of
distances that can be quickly and efficiently evaluated in
practice. We present both theoretical and numerical evidence
illustrating the improvements achieved by our method.
