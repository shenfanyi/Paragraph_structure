We connect shift-invariant characteristic kernels to infinitely
divisible distributions on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Characteristic
kernels play an important role in machine learning applications
with their kernel means to distinguish any two probability
measures. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we
show, using the Levy--Khintchine formula, that any shift-
invariant kernel given by a bounded, continuous, and symmetric
probability density function (pdf) of an infinitely divisible
distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is characteristic. We mention
some closure properties of such characteristic kernels under
addition, pointwise product, and convolution. Second, in
developing various kernel mean algorithms, it is fundamental to
compute the following values: (i) kernel mean values $m_P(x)$,
$x \in \mathcal{X}$, and (ii) kernel mean RKHS inner products
${\left\langle m_P, m_Q \right\rangle _{\mathcal{H}}}$, for
probability measures $P, Q$. If $P, Q$, and kernel $k$ are
Gaussians, then the computation of (i) and (ii) results in
Gaussian pdfs that are tractable. We generalize this Gaussian
combination to more general cases in the class of infinitely
divisible distributions. We then introduce a
