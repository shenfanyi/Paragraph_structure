One of the most fundamental problems in causal inference is the
estimation of a causal effect when treatment and outcome are
confounded. This is difficult in an observational study, because
one has no direct evidence that all confounders have been
adjusted for. We introduce a novel approach for estimating
causal effects that exploits observational conditional
independencies to suggest “weak” paths in an unknown causal
graph. The widely used faithfulness condition of Spirtes et al.
is relaxed to allow for varying degrees of “path cancellations”
that imply conditional independencies but do not rule out the
existence of confounding causal paths. The output is a posterior
distribution over bounds on the average causal effect via a
linear programming approach and Bayesian inference. We claim
this approach should be used in regular practice as a complement
to other tools in observational studies.
