Domain adaptation is the supervised learning setting in which
the training and test data are sampled from different
distributions: training data is sampled from a source domain,
whilst test data is sampled from a target domain. This paper
proposes and studies an approach, called feature-level domain
adaptation (FLDA), that models the dependence between the two
domains by means of a feature-level transfer model that is
trained to describe the transfer from source to target domain.
Subsequently, we train a domain-adapted classifier by minimizing
the expected loss under the resulting transfer model. For linear
classifiers and a large family of loss functions and transfer
models, this expected loss can be computed or approximated
analytically, and minimized efficiently. Our empirical
evaluation of FLDA focuses on problems comprising binary and
count data in which the transfer can be naturally modeled via a
dropout distribution, which allows the classifier to adapt to
differences in the marginal probability of features in the
source and the target domain. Our experiments on several real-
world problems show that FLDA performs on par with state- of-
the-art domain-adaptation techniques.
