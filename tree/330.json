We propose a computationally efficient random walk on a convex
body which rapidly mixes with respect to a fixed log-concave
distribution and closely tracks a time-varying log-concave
distribution. We develop general theoretical guarantees on the
required number of steps; this number can be calculated on the
fly according to the distance from and the shape of the next
distribution. We then illustrate the technique on several
examples. Within the context of exponential families, the
proposed method produces samples from a posterior distribution
which is updated as data arrive in a streaming fashion. The
sampling technique can be used to track time-varying truncated
distributions, as well as to obtain samples from a changing
mixture model, fitted in a streaming fashion to data. In the
setting of linear optimization, the proposed method has oracle
complexity with best known dependence on the dimension for
certain geometries. In the context of online learning and
repeated games, the algorithm is an efficient method for
implementing no-regret mixture forecasting strategies.
Remarkably, in some of these examples, only one step of the
random walk is needed to track the next distribution.
