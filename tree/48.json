Structured tasks are distinctive: each task has its own measure
of performance, such as the word error rate in speech
recognition, the BLEU score in machine translation, the NDCG
score in information retrieval, or the intersection-over-union
score in visual object segmentation. This paper presents
StructED, a software package for learning structured prediction
models with training methods that aimed at optimizing the task
measure of performance. The package was written in Java and
released under the MIT license. It can be downloaded from
