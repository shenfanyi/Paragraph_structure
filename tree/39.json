High dimensional Poisson regression has become a standard
framework for the analysis of massive counts datasets. In this
work we estimate the intensity function of the Poisson
regression model by using a dictionary approach, which
generalizes the classical basis approach, combined with a Lasso
or a group-Lasso procedure. Selection depends on penalty weights
that need to be calibrated. Standard methodologies developed in
the Gaussian framework can not be directly applied to Poisson
models due to heteroscedasticity. Here we provide data-driven
weights for the Lasso and the group-Lasso derived from
concentration inequalities adapted to the Poisson case. We show
that the associated Lasso and group-Lasso procedures satisfy
fast and slow oracle inequalities. Simulations are used to
assess the empirical performance of our procedure, and an
original application to the analysis of Next Generation
Sequencing data is provided.
