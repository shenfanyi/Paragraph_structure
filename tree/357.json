In this work, we address the problem of solving a series of
underdetermined linear inverse problemblems subject to a
sparsity constraint. We generalize the spike-and-slab prior
distribution to encode a priori correlation of the support of
the solution in both space and time by imposing a transformed
Gaussian process on the spike-and-slab probabilities. An
expectation propagation (EP) algorithm for posterior inference
under the proposed model is derived. For large scale problems,
the standard EP algorithm can be prohibitively slow. We
therefore introduce three different approximation schemes to
reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we demonstrate the
proposed model using numerical experiments based on both
synthetic and real data sets.
