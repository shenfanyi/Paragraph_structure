This article introduces a class of first-order stationary time-
varying Pitman-Yor processes. Subsuming our construction of
time-varying Dirichlet processes presented in (Caron et al.,
2007), these models can be used for time-dynamic density
estimation and clustering. Our intuitive and simple construction
relies on a generalized PÃ³lya urn scheme. Significantly, this
construction yields marginal distributions at each time point
that can be explicitly characterized and easily controlled.
Inference is performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo and
sequential Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate our models and
algorithms on epidemiological and video tracking data.
