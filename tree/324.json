This paper makes two contributions to Bayesian machine learning
algorithms. Firstly, we propose stochastic natural gradient
expectation propagation (SNEP), a novel alternative to
expectation propagation (EP), a popular variational inference
algorithm. SNEP is a black box variational algorithm, in that it
does not require any simplifying assumptions on the distribution
of interest, beyond the existence of some Monte Carlo sampler
for estimating the moments of the EP tilted distributions.
Further, as opposed to EP which has no guarantee of convergence,
SNEP can be shown to be convergent, even when using Monte Carlo
moment estimates. Secondly, we propose a novel architecture for
distributed Bayesian learning which we call the posterior
server. The posterior server allows scalable and robust Bayesian
learning in cases where a data set is stored in a distributed
manner across a cluster, with each compute node containing a
disjoint subset of data. An independent Monte Carlo sampler is
run on each compute node, with direct access only to the local
data subset, but which targets an approximation to the global
posterior distribution given all data across the whole cluster.
This is achieved by using a distributed asynchronous
implementation of SNEP to pass messages across the cluster. We
demonstrate SNEP and the posterior server on distributed
Bayesian learning of logistic regression and neural networks.
