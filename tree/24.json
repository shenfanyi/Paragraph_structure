On-line portfolio selection is a practical financial engineering
problem, which aims to sequentially allocate capital among a set
of assets in order to maximize long-term return. In recent
years, a variety of machine learning algorithms have been
proposed to address this challenging problem, but no
comprehensive open-source toolbox has been released for various
reasons. This article presents the first open-source toolbox for
"On-Line Portfolio Selection" (OLPS), which implements a
collection of classical and state-of-the-art strategies powered
by machine learning algorithms. We hope that OLPS can facilitate
the development of new learning methods and enable the
performance benchmarking and comparisons of different
strategies. OLPS is an open-source project released under Apache
License (version 2.0), which is available at
