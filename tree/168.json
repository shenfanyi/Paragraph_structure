Cluster analysis by nonnegative low-rank approximations has
experienced a remarkable progress in the past decade. However,
the majority of such approximation approaches are still
restricted to nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and suffer
from the following two drawbacks: 1) they are unable to produce
balanced partitions for large-scale manifold data which are
common in real-world clustering tasks; 2) most existing NMF-type
clustering methods cannot automatically determine the number of
clusters. We propose a new low-rank learning method to address
these two problems, which is beyond matrix factorization. Our
method approximately decomposes a sparse input similarity in a
normalized way and its objective can be used to learn both
cluster assignments and the number of clusters. For efficient
optimization, we use a relaxed formulation based on Data-
Cluster-Data random walk, which is also shown to be equivalent
to low-rank factorization of the doubly-stochastically
normalized cluster incidence matrix. The probabilistic cluster
assignments can thus be learned with a multiplicative
majorization-minimization algorithm. Experimental results show
that the new method is more accurate both in terms of clustering
large-scale manifold data sets and of selecting the number of
clusters.
