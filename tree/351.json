We propose a generic Bayesian mixed-effects model to estimate
the temporal progression of a biological phenomenon from
observations obtained at multiple time points for a group of
individuals. The progression is modeled by continuous
trajectories in the space of measurements. Individual
trajectories of progression result from spatiotemporal
transformations of an average trajectory. These transformations
allow for the quantification of changes in direction and pace at
which the trajectories are followed. The framework of Riemannian
geometry allows the model to be used with any kind of
measurements with smooth constraints. A stochastic version of
the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to produce
maximum
