We propose a spectral clustering method based on local principal
components analysis (PCA). After performing local PCA in
selected neighborhoods, the algorithm builds a nearest neighbor
graph weighted according to a discrepancy between the principal
subspaces in the neighborhoods, and then applies spectral
clustering. As opposed to standard spectral methods based solely
on pairwise distances between points, our algorithm is able to
resolve intersections. We establish theoretical guarantees for
simpler variants within a prototypical mathematical framework
for multi-manifold clustering, and evaluate our algorithm on
various simulated data sets.
