We propose a mixed integer programming (MIP) model and iterative
algorithms based on topological orders to solve optimization
problems with acyclic constraints on a directed graph. The
proposed MIP model has a significantly lower number of
constraints compared to popular MIP models based on cycle
elimination constraints and triangular inequalities. The
proposed iterative algorithms use gradient descent and iterative
reordering approaches, respectively, for searching topological
orders. A computational experiment is presented for the Gaussian
Bayesian network learning problem, an optimization problem
minimizing the sum of squared errors of regression models with
L1 penalty over a feature network with application of gene
network inference in bioinformatics.
