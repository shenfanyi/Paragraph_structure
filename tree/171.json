We consider a hidden Markov model, where the signal process,
given by a diffusion, is only indirectly observed through some
noisy measurements. The article develops a variational method
for approximating the hidden states of the signal process given
the full set of observations. This, in particular, leads to
systematic approximations of the smoothing densities of the
signal process. The paper then demonstrates how an efficient
inference scheme, based on this variational approach to the
approximation of the hidden states, can be designed to estimate
the unknown parameters of stochastic differential equations. Two
examples at the end illustrate the efficacy and the accuracy of
the presented method.
