The Dantzig selector has received popularity for many
applications such as compressed sensing and sparse modeling,
thanks to its computational efficiency as a linear programming
problem and its nice sampling properties. Existing results show
that it can recover sparse signals mimicking the accuracy of the
ideal procedure, up to a logarithmic factor of the
dimensionality. Such a factor has been shown to hold for many
regularization methods. An important question is whether this
factor can be reduced to a logarithmic factor of the sample size
in ultra-high dimensions under mild regularity conditions. To
provide an affirmative answer, in this paper we suggest the
constrained Dantzig selector, which has more flexible
constraints and parameter space. We prove that the suggested
method can achieve convergence rates within a logarithmic factor
of the sample size of the oracle rates and improved sparsity,
under a fairly weak assumption on the signal strength. Such
improvement is significant in ultra-high dimensions. This method
can be implemented efficiently through sequential linear
programming. Numerical studies confirm that the sample size
needed for a certain level of accuracy in these problems can be
much reduced.
