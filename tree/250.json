We derive generalization error bounds for traditional time-
series forecasting models. Our results hold for many standard
forecasting tools including autoregressive models, moving
average models, and, more generally, linear state-space models.
These non-asymptotic bounds need only weak assumptions on the
data-generating process, yet allow forecasters to select among
competing models and to guarantee, with high probability, that
their chosen model will perform well. We motivate our techniques
with and apply them to standard economic and financial
forecasting tools---a GARCH model for predicting equity
volatility and a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model
(DSGE), the standard tool in macroeconomic forecasting. We
demonstrate in particular how our techniques can aid forecasters
and policy makers in choosing models which behave well under
uncertainty and mis-specification.
