Control of non-episodic, finite-horizon dynamical systems with
uncertain dynamics poses a tough and elementary case of the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. Bayesian reinforcement
learning, reasoning about the effect of actions and future
observations, offers a principled solution, but is intractable.
We review, then extend an old approximate approach from control
theory---where the problem is known as
