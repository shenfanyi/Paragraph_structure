This paper presents the Averaged CVB (ACVB) inference and offers
convergence-guaranteed and practically useful fast Collapsed
Variational Bayes (CVB) inferences. CVB inferences yield more
precise inferences of Bayesian probabilistic models than
Variational Bayes (VB) inferences. However, their convergence
aspect is fairly unknown and has not been scrutinized. To make
CVB more useful, we study their convergence behaviors in a
empirical and practical approach. We develop a convergence-
guaranteed algorithm for any CVB-based inference called ACVB,
which enables automatic convergence detection and frees non-
expert practitioners from the difficult and costly manual
monitoring of inference processes. In experiments, ACVB
inferences are comparable to or better than those of existing
inference methods and deterministic, fast, and provide easier
convergence detection. These features are especially convenient
for practitioners who want precise Bayesian inference with
assured convergence.
