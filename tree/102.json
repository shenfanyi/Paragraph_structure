This paper presents a dependent multi-output Gaussian process
(GP) for modeling complex dynamical systems. The outputs are
dependent in this model, which is largely different from
previous GP dynamical systems. We adopt convolved multi-output
GPs to model the outputs, which are provided with a flexible
multi-output covariance function. We adapt the variational
inference method with inducing points for learning the model.
Conjugate gradient based optimization is used to solve
parameters involved by maximizing the variational lower bound of
the marginal likelihood. The proposed model has superiority on
modeling dynamical systems under the more reasonable assumption
and the fully Bayesian learning framework. Further, it can be
flexibly extended to handle regression problems. We evaluate the
model on both synthetic and real-world data including motion
capture data, traffic flow data and robot inverse dynamics data.
Various evaluation methods are taken on the experiments to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, and encouraging
results are observed.
