RLScore is a Python open source module for kernel based machine
learning. The library provides implementations of several
regularized least-squares (RLS) type of learners. RLS methods
for regression and classification, ranking, greedy feature
selection, multi-task and zero-shot learning, and unsupervised
classification are included. Matrix algebra based computational
short-cuts are used to ensure efficiency of both training and
cross-validation. A simple API and extensive tutorials allow for
easy use of RLScore.
