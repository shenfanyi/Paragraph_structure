We present a method for extracting depth information from a
rectified image pair. Our approach focuses on the first stage of
many stereo algorithms: the matching cost computation. We
approach the problem by learning a similarity measure on small
image patches using a convolutional neural network. Training is
carried out in a supervised manner by constructing a binary
classification data set with examples of similar and dissimilar
pairs of patches. We examine two network architectures for this
task: one tuned for speed, the other for accuracy. The output of
the convolutional neural network is used to initialize the
stereo matching cost. A series of post-processing steps follow:
cross-based cost aggregation, semiglobal matching, a left-right
consistency check, subpixel enhancement, a median filter, and a
bilateral filter. We evaluate our method on the KITTI 2012,
KITTI 2015, and Middlebury stereo data sets and show that it
outperforms other approaches on all three data sets.
