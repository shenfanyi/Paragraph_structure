CVXPY is a domain-specific language for convex optimization
embedded in Python. It allows the user to express convex
optimization problems in a natural syntax that follows the math,
rather than in the restrictive standard form required by
solvers. CVXPY makes it easy to combine convex optimization with
high-level features of Python such as parallelism and object-
oriented design. CVXPY is available at
