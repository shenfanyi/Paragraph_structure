Associating distinct groups of objects (clusters) with
contiguous regions of high probability density (high-density
clusters), is central to many statistical and machine learning
approaches to the classification of unlabelled data. We propose
a novel hyperplane classifier for clustering and semi-supervised
classification which is motivated by this objective. The
