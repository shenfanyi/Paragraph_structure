Factorization Machines (FM) are currently only used in a narrow
range of applications and are not yet part of the standard
machine learning toolbox, despite their great success in
collaborative filtering and click-through rate prediction.
However, Factorization Machines are a general model to deal with
sparse and high dimensional features. Our Factorization Machine
implementation (fastFM) provides easy access to many solvers and
supports regression, classification and ranking tasks. Such an
implementation simplifies the use of FM for a wide range of
applications. Therefore, our implementation has the potential to
improve understanding of the FM model and drive new development.
