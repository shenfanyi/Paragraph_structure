In machine learning, one often encounters data sets where a
general pattern is violated by a relatively small number of
exceptions (for example, a rule that says that all birds can fly
is violated by examples such as penguins). This complicates the
concept learning process and may lead to the rejection of some
simple and expressive rules that cover many cases. In this paper
we present an approach to this problem in description logic
learning by computing partial descriptions (which are not
necessarily entirely complete) of both positive and negative
examples and combining them. Our
