Approximate inference in high-dimensional, discrete
probabilistic models is a central problem in computational
statistics and machine learning. This paper describes discrete
particle variational inference (DPVI), a new approach that
combines key strengths of Monte Carlo, variational and search-
based techniques. DPVI is based on a novel family of particle-
based variational approximations that can be fit using simple,
fast, deterministic search techniques. Like Monte Carlo, DPVI
can handle multiple modes, and yields exact results in a well-
defined limit. Like unstructured mean-field, DPVI is based on
optimizing a lower bound on the partition function; when this
quantity is not of intrinsic interest, it facilitates
convergence assessment and debugging. Like both Monte Carlo and
combinatorial search, DPVI can take advantage of factorization,
sequential structure, and custom search operators. This paper
defines DPVI particle-based approximation family and partition
function lower bounds, along with the sequential DPVI and local
DPVI algorithm templates for optimizing them. DPVI is
illustrated and evaluated via experiments on lattice Markov
Random Fields, nonparametric Bayesian mixtures and block-models,
and parametric as well as non-parametric hidden Markov models.
Results include applications to real-world spike-sorting and
relational modeling problems, and show that DPVI can offer
appealing time/accuracy trade-offs as compared to multiple
alternatives.
