We provide a hierarchical Bayesian model for estimating the
effects of transient drug exposures on a collection of health
outcomes, where the effects of all drugs on all outcomes are
estimated simultaneously. The method possesses properties that
allow it to handle important challenges of dealing with large-
scale longitudinal observational databases. In particular, this
model is a generalization of the self-controlled case series
(SCCS) method, meaning that certain patient specific baseline
rates never need to be estimated. Further, this model is
formulated with layers of latent factors, which substantially
reduces the number of parameters and helps with interpretability
by illuminating latent classes of drugs and outcomes. We believe
our work is the first to consider multivariate SCCS (in the
sense of multiple outcomes) and is the first to couple latent
factor analysis with SCCS. We demonstrate the approach by
estimating the effects of various time-sensitive insulin
treatments for diabetes.
