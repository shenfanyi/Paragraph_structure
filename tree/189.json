This paper studies $V$-fold cross-validation for model selection
in least-squares density estimation. The goal is to provide
theoretical grounds for choosing $V$ in order to minimize the
least-squares loss of the selected estimator. We first prove a
non-asymptotic oracle inequality for $V$-fold cross-validation
and its bias-corrected version ($V$-fold penalization). In
particular, this result implies that $V$-fold penalization is
asymptotically optimal in the nonparametric case. Then, we
compute the variance of $V$-fold cross-validation and related
criteria, as well as the variance of key quantities for model
selection performance. We show that these variances depend on
$V$ like $1+4/(V-1)$, at least in some particular cases,
suggesting that the performance increases much from $V=2$ to
$V=5$ or $10$, and then is almost constant. Overall, this can
explain the common advice to take $V=5\,$---at least in our
setting and when the computational power is limited---, as
supported by some simulation experiments. An oracle inequality
and exact formulas for the variance are also proved for Monte-
Carlo cross-validation, also known as repeated cross-validation,
where the parameter $V$ is replaced by the number $B$ of random
splits of the data.
