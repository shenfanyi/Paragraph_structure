In this article, we develop and investigate a new classifier
based on features extracted using spatial depth. Our
construction is based on fitting a generalized additive model to
posterior probabilities of different competing classes. To cope
with possible multi-modal as well as non-elliptic nature of the
population distribution, we also develop a localized version of
spatial depth and use that with varying degrees of localization
to build the classifier. Final classification is done by
aggregating several posterior probability estimates, each of
which is obtained using this localized spatial depth with a
fixed scale of localization. The proposed classifier can be
conveniently used even when the dimension of the data is larger
than the sample size, and its good discriminatory power for such
data has been established using theoretical as well as numerical
results.
