Predicting breast cancer risk has long been a goal of medical
research in the pursuit of precision medicine. The goal of this
study is to develop novel penalized methods to improve breast
cancer risk prediction by leveraging structure information in
electronic health records. We conducted a retrospective case-
control study, garnering 49 mammography descriptors and 77 high-
frequency/low-penetrance single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
from an existing personalized medicine data repository.
Structured mammography reports and breast imaging features have
long been part of a standard electronic health record (EHR), and
genetic markers likely will be in the near future. Lasso and its
variants are widely used approaches to integrated learning and
feature selection, and our methodological contribution is to
incorporate the dependence structure among the features into
these approaches. More specifically, we propose a new
methodology by combining group penalty and $\ell^p$ ($1\leq
p\leq2$) fusion penalty to improve breast cancer risk
prediction, taking into account structure information in
mammography descriptors and SNPs. We demonstrate that our method
provides benefits that are both statistically significant and
potentially significant to people's lives.
