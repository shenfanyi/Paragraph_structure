We describe a seriation algorithm for ranking a set of items
given pairwise comparisons between these items. Intuitively, the
algorithm assigns similar rankings to items that compare
similarly with all others. It does so by constructing a
similarity matrix from pairwise comparisons, using seriation
methods to reorder this matrix and construct a ranking. We first
show that this spectral seriation algorithm recovers the true
ranking when all pairwise comparisons are observed and
consistent with a total order. We then show that ranking
reconstruction is still exact when some pairwise comparisons are
corrupted or missing, and that seriation based spectral ranking
is more robust to noise than classical scoring methods. Finally,
we bound the ranking error when only a random subset of the
comparions are observed. An additional benefit of the seriation
formulation is that it allows us to solve semi-supervised
ranking problems. Experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets demonstrate that seriation based spectral ranking
achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance
compared to classical ranking methods.
