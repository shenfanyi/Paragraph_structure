Symmetric positive semidefinite (SPSD) matrix approximation is
an important problem with applications in kernel methods.
However, existing SPSD matrix approximation methods such as the
Nystr√∂m method only have weak error bounds. In this paper we
conduct in-depth studies of an SPSD matrix approximation model
and establish strong relative-error bounds. We call it the
prototype model for it has more efficient and effective
extensions, and some of its extensions have high scalability.
Though the prototype model itself is not suitable for large-
scale data, it is still useful to study its properties, on which
the analysis of its extensions relies. This paper offers novel
theoretical analysis, efficient algorithms, and a highly
accurate extension. First, we establish a lower error bound for
the prototype model and improve the error bound of an existing
column selection algorithm to match the lower bound. In this
way, we obtain the first optimal column selection algorithm for
the prototype model. We also prove that the prototype model is
exact under certain conditions. Second, we develop a simple
column selection algorithm with a provable error bound. Third,
we propose a so-called spectral shifting model to make the
approximation more accurate when the eigenvalues of the matrix
decay slowly, and the improvement is theoretically quantified.
The spectral shifting method can also be applied to improve
other SPSD matrix approximation models.
