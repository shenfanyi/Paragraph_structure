In high-dimensional data, structured noise caused by observed
and unobserved factors affecting multiple target variables
simultaneously, imposes a serious challenge for modeling, by
masking the often weak signal. Therefore, (1) explaining away
the structured noise in multiple-output regression is of
paramount importance. Additionally, (2) assumptions about the
correlation structure of the regression weights are needed. We
note that both can be formulated in a natural way in a latent
variable model, in which both the interesting signal and the
noise are mediated through the same latent factors. Under this
assumption, the signal model then borrows strength from the
noise model by encouraging similar effects on correlated
targets. We introduce a hyperparameter for the
