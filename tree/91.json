Despite tremendous progress in computer vision, there has not
been an attempt to apply machine learning on very large-scale
medical image databases. We present an interleaved text/image
deep learning system to extract and mine the semantic
interactions of radiology images and reports from a national
research hospital's Picture Archiving and Communication System.
With natural language processing, we mine a collection of
$\sim$216K representative two-dimensional images selected by
clinicians for diagnostic reference and match the images with
their descriptions in an automated manner. We then employ a
weakly supervised approach using all of our available data to
build models for generating approximate interpretations of
patient images. Finally, we demonstrate a more strictly
supervised approach to detect the presence and absence of a
number of frequent disease types, providing more specific
interpretations of patient scans. A relatively small amount of
data is used for this part, due to the challenge in gathering
quality labels from large raw text data. Our work shows the
feasibility of large-scale learning and prediction in electronic
patient records available in most modern clinical institutions.
It also demonstrates the trade-offs to consider in designing
machine learning systems for analyzing large medical data.
