In this paper, we explore statistical versus computational
trade-off to address a basic question in the application of a
distributed algorithm: what is the minimal computational cost in
obtaining statistical optimality? In smoothing spline setup, we
observe a phase transition phenomenon for the number of deployed
machines that ends up being a simple proxy for computing cost.
Specifically, a
