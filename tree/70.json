Matrix factorization (MF) plays a key role in many applications
such as recommender systems and computer vision, but MF may take
long running time for handling large matrices commonly seen in
the big data era. Many parallel techniques have been proposed to
reduce the running time, but few parallel MF packages are
available. Therefore, we present an open source library, LIBMF,
based on recent advances of parallel MF for shared-memory
systems. LIBMF includes easy-to-use command-line tools,
interfaces to C/C++ languages, and comprehensive documentation.
Our experiments demonstrate that LIBMF outperforms state of the
art packages. LIBMF is BSD-licensed, so users can freely use,
modify, and redistribute the code.
