We introduce a family of adaptive estimators on graphs, based on
penalizing the $\ell_1$ norm of discrete graph differences. This
generalizes the idea of trend filtering (Kim et al., 2009;
Tibshirani, 2014), used for univariate nonparametric regression,
to graphs. Analogous to the univariate case, graph trend
filtering exhibits a level of local adaptivity unmatched by the
usual $\ell_2$-based graph smoothers. It is also defined by a
convex minimization problem that is readily solved (e.g., by
fast ADMM or Newton algorithms). We demonstrate the merits of
graph trend filtering through both examples and theory.
