We study a regularizer which is defined as a parameterized
infimum of quadratics, and which we call the box-norm. We show
that the $k$-support norm, a regularizer proposed by Argyriou et
al. (2012) for sparse vector prediction problems, belongs to
this family, and the box-norm can be generated as a perturbation
of the former. We derive an improved algorithm to compute the
proximity operator of the squared box-norm, and we provide a
method to compute the norm. We extend the norms to matrices,
introducing the spectral $k$-support norm and spectral box-norm.
We note that the spectral box-norm is essentially equivalent to
the cluster norm, a multitask learning regularizer introduced by
Jacob et al. (2009a), and which in turn can be interpreted as a
perturbation of the spectral $k$-support norm. Centering the
norm is important for multitask learning and we also provide a
method to use centered versions of the norms as regularizers.
Numerical experiments indicate that the spectral $k$-support and
box-norms and their centered variants provide state of the art
performance in matrix completion and multitask learning problems
respectively.
