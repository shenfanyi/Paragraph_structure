The R package GFA provides a full pipeline for factor analysis
of multiple data sources that are represented as matrices with
co-occurring samples. It allows learning dependencies between
subsets of the data sources, decomposed into latent factors. The
package also implements sparse priors for the factorization,
providing interpretable biclusters of the multi-source data.
