Obtaining labels can be costly and time-consuming. Active
learning allows a learning algorithm to intelligently query
samples to be labeled for a more efficient learning. Fisher
information ratio (FIR) has been used as an objective for
selecting queries. However, little is known about the theory
behind the use of FIR for active learning. There is a gap
between the underlying theory and the motivation of its usage in
practice. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap and provide
a rigorous framework for analyzing existing FIR-based active
learning methods. In particular, we show that FIR can be
asymptotically viewed as an upper bound of the expected variance
of the log-likelihood ratio. Additionally, our analysis suggests
a unifying framework that not only enables us to make
theoretical comparisons among the existing querying methods
based on FIR, but also allows us to give insight into the
development of new active learning approaches based on this
objective.
