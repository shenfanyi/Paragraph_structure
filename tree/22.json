Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to improve generalization
performance by learning multiple related tasks simultaneously.
While sometimes the underlying task relationship structure is
known, often the structure needs to be estimated from data at
hand. In this paper, we present a novel family of models for
MTL, applicable to regression and classification problems,
capable of learning the structure of tasks relationship. In
particular, we consider a joint estimation problem of the tasks
relationship structure and the individual task parameters, which
is solved using alternating minimization. The task relationship
revealed by structure learning is founded on recent advances in
Gaussian graphical models endowed with sparse estimators of the
precision (inverse covariance) matrix. An extension to include
flexible Gaussian copula models that relaxes the Gaussian
marginal assumption is also proposed. We illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model on a variety of synthetic
and benchmark data sets for regression and classification. We
also consider the problem of combining Earth System Model (ESM)
outputs for better projections of future climate, with focus on
projections of temperature by combining ESMs in South and North
America, and show that the proposed model outperforms several
existing methods for the problem.
