Probabilistic modeling is iterative. A scientist posits a simple
model, fits it to her data, refines it according to her
analysis, and repeats. However, fitting complex models to large
data is a bottleneck in this process. Deriving algorithms for
new models can be both mathematically and computationally
challenging, which makes it difficult to efficiently cycle
through the steps. To this end, we develop ADVI. Using our
method, the scientist only provides a probabilistic model and a
dataset, nothing else. ADVI automatically derives an efficient
variational inference algorithm, freeing the scientist to refine
and explore many models. ADVI supports a broad class of models
---no conjugacy assumptions are required. We study ADVI across
ten modern probabilistic models and apply it to a dataset with
millions of observations. We deploy ADVI as part of Stan, a
probabilistic programming system.
