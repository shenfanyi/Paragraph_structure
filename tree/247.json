Factor Analysis (FA) is a technique of fundamental importance
that is widely used in classical and modern multivariate
statistics, psychometrics, and econometrics. In this paper, we
revisit the classical rank-constrained FA problem which seeks to
approximate an observed covariance matrix ($\B\Sigma$) by the
sum of a Positive Semidefinite (PSD) low-rank component
($\B\Theta$) and a diagonal matrix ($\B\Phi$) (with nonnegative
entries) subject to $\B\Sigma - \B\Phi$ being PSD. We propose a
flexible family of rank-constrained, nonlinear Semidefinite
Optimization based formulations for this task. We introduce a
reformulation of the problem as a smooth optimization problem
with convex, compact constraints and propose a unified
algorithmic framework, utilizing state of the art techniques in
nonlinear optimization to obtain high-quality feasible solutions
for our proposed formulation. At the same time, by using a
variety of techniques from discrete and global optimization, we
show that these solutions are
