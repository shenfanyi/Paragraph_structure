Many applications, such as human action recognition and object
detection, can be formulated as a multiclass classification
problem. One-vs-rest (OVR) is one of the most widely used
approaches for multiclass classification due to its simplicity
and excellent performance. However, many confusing classes in
such applications will degrade its results. For example,
