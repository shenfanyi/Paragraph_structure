Many data sets can be viewed as a noisy sampling of an
underlying space, and tools from topological data analysis can
characterize this structure for the purpose of knowledge
discovery. One such tool is persistent homology, which provides
a multiscale description of the homological features within a
data set. A useful representation of this homological
information is a
