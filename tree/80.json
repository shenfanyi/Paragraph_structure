We formulate a new variant of the problem of planning in an
unknown environment, for which we can provide algorithms with
reasonable theoretical guarantees in spite of large state spaces
and time horizons, partial observability, and complex dynamics.
In this variant, an agent is given a collection of example
traces produced by a reference policy, which may, for example,
capture the agent's past behavior. The agent is (only) asked to
find policies that are supported by regularities in the dynamics
that are observable on these example traces. We describe an
efficient algorithm that uses such
