Community detection is a fundamental statistical problem in
network data analysis.  In this paper, we present a polynomial
time two-stage method that provably achieves optimal statistical
performance in misclassification proportion for stochastic block
model under weak regularity conditions. Our two-stage procedure
consists of a refinement stage motivated by penalized local
maximum likelihood estimation. This stage can take a wide range
of weakly consistent community detection procedures as its
initializer, to which it applies and outputs a community
assignment that achieves optimal misclassification proportion
with high probability. The theoretical property is confirmed by
simulated examples.
