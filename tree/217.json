Conditional random fields maximize the log-likelihood of
training labels given the training data, e.g., objects given
images. In many cases the training labels are structures that
consist of a set of variables and the computational complexity
for estimating their likelihood is exponential in the number of
the variables. Learning algorithms relax this computational
burden using approximate inference that is nested as a sub-
procedure. In this paper we describe the objective function for
nested learning and inference in conditional random fields. The
devised objective maximizes the log-beliefs --- probability
distributions over subsets of training variables that agree on
their marginal probabilities. This objective is concave and
consists of two types of variables that are related to the
learning and inference tasks respectively. Importantly, we
afterwards show how to blend the learning and inference
procedure and effectively get to the identical optimum much
faster. The proposed algorithm currently achieves the state-of-
the-art in various computer vision applications.
