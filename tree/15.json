This work develops formal statistical inference procedures for
predictions generated by supervised learning ensembles. Ensemble
methods based on bootstrapping, such as bagging and random
forests, have improved the predictive accuracy of individual
trees, but fail to provide a framework in which distributional
results can be easily determined. Instead of aggregating full
bootstrap samples, we consider predicting by averaging over
trees built on subsamples of the training set and demonstrate
that the resulting estimator takes the form of a U-statistic. As
such, predictions for individual feature vectors are
asymptotically normal, allowing for confidence intervals to
accompany predictions. In practice, a subset of subsamples is
used for computational speed; here our estimators take the form
of incomplete U-statistics and equivalent results are derived.
We further demonstrate that this setup provides a framework for
testing the significance of features. Moreover, the internal
estimation method we develop allows us to estimate the variance
parameters and perform these inference procedures at no
additional computational cost. Simulations and illustrations on
a real data set are provided.
