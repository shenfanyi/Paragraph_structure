Complex chronic diseases (e.g., autism, lupus, and Parkinson's)
are remarkably heterogeneous across individuals. This
heterogeneity makes treatment difficult for caregivers because
they cannot accurately predict the way in which the disease will
progress in order to guide treatment decisions. Therefore, tools
that help to predict the trajectory of these complex chronic
diseases can help to improve the quality of health care. To
build such tools, we can leverage clinical markers that are
collected at baseline when a patient first presents and
longitudinally over time during follow-up visits. Because
complex chronic diseases are typically systemic, the
longitudinal markers often track disease progression in multiple
organ systems. In this paper, our goal is to predict a function
of time that models the future trajectory of a single target
clinical marker tracking a disease process of interest. We want
to make these predictions using the histories of many related
clinical markers as input. Our proposed solution tackles several
key challenges. First, we can easily handle irregularly and
sparsely sampled markers, which are standard in clinical data.
Second, the number of parameters and the computational
complexity of learning our model grows linearly in the number of
marker types included in the model. This makes our approach
applicable to diseases where many different markers are recorded
over time. Finally, our model accounts for latent factors
influencing disease expression, whereas standard regression
models rely on observed features alone to explain variability.
Moreover, our approach can be applied dynamically in continous-
time and updates its predictions as soon as any new data is
available. We apply our approach to the problem of predicting
lung disease trajectories in scleroderma, a complex autoimmune
disease. We show that our model improves over state-of-the-art
baselines in predictive accuracy and we provide a qualitative
analysis of our model's output. Finally, the variability of
disease presentation in scleroderma makes clinical trial
recruitment challenging. We show that a prognostic tool that
integrates multiple types of routinely collected longitudinal
data can be used to identify individuals at greatest risk of
rapid progression and to target trial recruitment.
