We present a systematic study of the bipartite ranking problem,
with the aim of explicating its connections to the class-
probability estimation problem. Our study focuses on the
properties of the statistical risk for bipartite ranking with
general losses, which is closely related to a generalised notion
of the area under the ROC curve: we establish alternate
representations of this risk, relate the Bayes-optimal risk to a
class of probability divergences, and characterise the set of
Bayes-optimal scorers for the risk. We further study properties
of a generalised class of bipartite risks, based on the $p$-norm
push of Rudin (2009). Our analysis is based on the rich
framework of proper losses, which are the central tool in the
study of class-probability estimation. We show how this analytic
tool makes transparent the generalisations of several existing
results, such as the equivalence of the minimisers for four
seemingly disparate risks from bipartite ranking and class-
probability estimation. A novel practical implication of our
analysis is the design of new families of losses for scenarios
where accuracy at the head of ranked list is paramount, with
comparable empirical performance to the $p$-norm push.
