Symmetric positive semi-definite (SPSD) matrix approximation
methods have been extensively used to speed up large-scale
eigenvalue computation and kernel learning methods. The standard
sketch based method, which we call the prototype model, produces
relatively accurate approximations, but is inefficient on large
square matrices. The Nystr√∂m method is highly efficient, but
can only achieve low accuracy. In this paper we propose a novel
model that we call the
