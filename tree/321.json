We consider two settings of online learning to rank where
feedback is restricted to top ranked items. The problem is cast
as an online game between a learner and sequence of users, over
$T$ rounds. In both settings, the learners objective is to
present ranked list of items to the users. The learner's
performance is judged on the entire ranked list and true
relevances of the items. However, the learner receives highly
restricted feedback at end of each round, in form of relevances
of only the top $k$ ranked items, where $k \ll m$. The first
setting is
