Local differential privacy has recently surfaced as a strong
measure of privacy in contexts where personal information
remains private even from data analysts. Working in a setting
where both the data providers and data analysts want to maximize
the utility of statistical analyses performed on the released
data, we study the fundamental trade-off between local
differential privacy and utility. This trade-off is formulated
as a constrained optimization problem: maximize utility subject
to local differential privacy constraints. We introduce a
combinatorial family of extremal privatization mechanisms, which
we call staircase mechanisms, and show that it contains the
optimal privatization mechanisms for a broad class of
information theoretic utilities such as mutual information and
$f$-divergences. We further prove that for any utility function
and any privacy level, solving the privacy-utility maximization
problem is equivalent to solving a finite-dimensional linear
program, the outcome of which is the optimal staircase
mechanism. However, solving this linear program can be
computationally expensive since it has a number of variables
that is exponential in the size of the alphabet the data lives
in. To account for this, we show that two simple privatization
mechanisms, the binary and randomized response mechanisms, are
universally optimal in the low and high privacy regimes, and
well approximate the intermediate regime.
