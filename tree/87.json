The future predictive performance of a Bayesian model can be
estimated using Bayesian cross-validation. In this article, we
consider Gaussian latent variable models where the integration
over the latent values is approximated using the Laplace method
or expectation propagation (EP). We study the properties of
several Bayesian leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation
approximations that in most cases can be computed with a small
additional cost after forming the posterior approximation given
the full data. Our main objective is to assess the
