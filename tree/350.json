We consider the submodular function minimization (SFM) and the
quadratic minimization problems regularized by the Lovasz
extension of the submodular function. These optimization
problems are intimately related; for example, min-cut problems
and total variation denoising problems, where the cut function
is submodular and its Lovasz extension is given by the
associated total variation. When a quadratic loss is regularized
by the total variation of a cut function, it thus becomes a
total variation denoising problem and we use the same
terminology in this paper for
