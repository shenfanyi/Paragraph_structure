We present Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimation (NADE)
models, which are neural network architectures applied to the
problem of unsupervised distribution and density estimation.
They leverage the probability product rule and a weight sharing
scheme inspired from restricted Boltzmann machines, to yield an
estimator that is both tractable and has good generalization
performance. We discuss how they achieve competitive performance
in modeling both binary and real-valued observations. We also
present how deep NADE models can be trained to be agnostic to
the ordering of input dimensions used by the autoregressive
product rule decomposition. Finally, we also show how to exploit
the topological structure of pixels in images using a deep
convolutional architecture for NADE.
