Most existing binary classification methods target on the
optimization of the overall classification risk and may fail to
serve some real-world applications such as cancer diagnosis,
where users are more concerned with the risk of misclassifying
one specific class than the other. Neyman-Pearson (NP) paradigm
was introduced in this context as a novel statistical framework
for handling asymmetric type I/II error priorities. It seeks
classifiers with a minimal type II error and a constrained type
I error under a user specified level. This article is the first
attempt to construct classifiers with guaranteed theoretical
performance under the NP paradigm in high-dimensional settings.
Based on the fundamental Neyman-Pearson Lemma, we used a plug-in
approach to construct NP-type classifiers for Naive Bayes
models. The proposed classifiers satisfy the NP oracle
inequalities, which are natural NP paradigm counterparts of the
oracle inequalities in classical binary classification. Besides
their desirable theoretical properties, we also demonstrated
their numerical advantages in prioritized error control via both
simulation and real data studies.
