We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for a type of
asymmetry between causes and effects that is present when these
are related via linear models contaminated with additive non-
Gaussian noise. Assuming that the causes and the effects have
the same distribution, we show that the distribution of the
residuals of a linear fit in the anti-causal direction is closer
to a Gaussian than the distribution of the residuals in the
causal direction. This Gaussianization effect is characterized
by reduction of the magnitude of the high-order cumulants and by
an increment of the differential entropy of the residuals. The
problem of non-linear causal inference is addressed by
performing an embedding in an expanded feature space, in which
the relation between causes and effects can be assumed to be
linear. The effectiveness of a method to discriminate between
causes and effects based on this type of asymmetry is
illustrated in a variety of experiments using different measures
of Gaussianity. The proposed method is shown to be competitive
with state-of-the-art techniques for causal inference.
