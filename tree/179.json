In this paper we introduce, in the setting of machine learning,
a generalization of wavelet analysis which is a popular approach
to low dimensional structured signal analysis. The wavelet
decomposition of a Random Forest provides a sparse approximation
of any regression or classification high dimensional function at
various levels of detail, with a concrete ordering of the Random
Forest nodes: from `significant' elements to nodes capturing
only `insignificant' noise. Motivated by function space theory,
we use the wavelet decomposition to compute numerically a `weak-
type' smoothness index that captures the complexity of the
underlying function. As we show through extensive
experimentation, this sparse representation facilitates a
variety of applications such as improved regression for
difficult datasets, a novel approach to feature importance,
resilience to noisy or irrelevant features, compression of
ensembles, etc.
