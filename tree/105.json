We develop a flexible framework for low-rank matrix estimation
that allows us to transform noise models into regularization
schemes via a simple bootstrap algorithm. Effectively, our
procedure seeks an autoencoding basis for the observed matrix
that is stable with respect to the specified noise model; we
call the resulting procedure a
