This paper presents an original Markov chain Monte Carlo method
to sample from the posterior distribution of conjugate mixture
models. This algorithm relies on a flexible split-merge
procedure built using the particle Gibbs sampler introduced in
Andrieu et al. (2009, 2010). The resulting so-called Particle
Gibbs Split-Merge sampler does not require the computation of a
complex acceptance ratio and can be implemented using existing
sequential Monte Carlo libraries. We investigate its performance
experimentally on synthetic problems as well as on geolocation
data. Our results show that for a given computational budget,
the Particle Gibbs Split-Merge sampler empirically outperforms
existing split merge methods. The code and instructions allowing
to reproduce the experiments is available at
