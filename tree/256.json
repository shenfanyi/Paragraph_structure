This paper takes a close look at the important commonalities and
subtle differences between the well-established field of
supervised learning and the much younger one of co-optimization.
It explains the relationships between the problems, algorithms
and views on cost and performance of the two fields, all
throughout providing a two-way dictionary for the respective
terminologies used to describe these concepts. The intent is to
facilitate advancement of both fields through transfer and
cross-pollination of ideas, techniques and results. As a proof
of concept, a theoretical study is presented on the connection
between existence / lack of free lunch in the two fields,
showcasing a few ideas for improving computational complexity of
certain supervised learning approaches.
