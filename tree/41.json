We present methods based on Metropolis-coupled Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MC3) and annealed importance sampling (AIS) for
estimating the posterior distribution of Bayesian networks. The
methods draw samples from an appropriate distribution of partial
orders on the nodes, continued by sampling directed acyclic
graphs (DAGs) conditionally on the sampled partial orders. We
show that the computations needed for the sampling algorithms
are feasible as long as the encountered partial orders have
relatively few down-sets. While the algorithms assume suitable
modularity properties of the priors, arbitrary priors can be
handled by dividing the importance weight of each sampled DAG by
the number of topological sorts it has---we give a practical
dynamic programming algorithm to compute these numbers. Our
empirical results demonstrate that the presented partial-order-
based samplers are superior to previous Markov chain Monte Carlo
methods, which sample DAGs either directly or via linear orders
on the nodes. The results also suggest that the convergence rate
of the estimators based on AIS are competitive to those of MC3.
Thus AIS is the preferred method, as it enables easier large-
scale parallelization and, in addition, supplies good
probabilistic lower bound guarantees for the marginal likelihood
of the model.
