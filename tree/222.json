SnapVX is a high-performance solver for convex optimization
problems defined on networks. For problems of this form, SnapVX
provides a fast and scalable solution with guaranteed global
convergence. It combines the capabilities of two open source
software packages: Snap.py and CVXPY. Snap.py is a large scale
graph processing library, and CVXPY provides a general modeling
framework for small-scale subproblems. SnapVX offers a
customizable yet easy-to-use Python interface with
