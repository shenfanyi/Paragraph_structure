Electronic Health Record (EHR) phenotyping utilizes patient data
captured through normal medical practice, to identify features
that may represent computational medical phenotypes. These
features may be used to identify at-risk patients and improve
prediction of patient morbidity and mortality. We present a
novel deep multi-modality architecture for EHR analysis
(applicable to joint analysis of
