This paper considers inference of causal structure in a class of
graphical models called conditional DAGs. These are directed
acyclic graph (DAG) models with two kinds of variables, primary
and secondary. The secondary variables are used to aid in the
estimation of the structure of causal relationships between the
primary variables. We prove that, under certain assumptions,
such causal structure is identifiable from the joint
observational distribution of the primary and secondary
variables. We give causal semantics for the model class, put
forward a score-based approach for estimation and establish
consistency results. Empirical results demonstrate gains
compared with formulations that treat all variables on an equal
footing, or that ignore secondary variables. The methodology is
motivated by applications in biology that involve multiple data
types and is illustrated here using simulated data and in an
analysis of molecular data from the Cancer Genome Atlas.
