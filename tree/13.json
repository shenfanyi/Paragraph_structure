Traditionally the machine-learning community has viewed the No
Free Lunch (NFL) theorems for search and optimization as a
limitation. We review, analyze, and unify the NFL theorem with
the perspectives of "blind" search and meta-learning to arrive
at necessary conditions for improving black-box optimization. We
survey meta-learning literature to determine when and how meta-
learning can benefit machine learning. Then, we generalize meta-
learning in the context of the NFL theorems, to arrive at a
novel technique called
