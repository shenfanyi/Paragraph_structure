Biclustering structures in data matrices were first formalized
in a seminal paper by John Hartigan (Hartigan, 1972) where one
seeks to cluster cases and variables simultaneously. Such
structures are also prevalent in block modeling of networks. In
this paper, we develop a theory for the estimation and
completion of matrices with biclustering structures, where the
data is a partially observed and noise contaminated matrix with
a certain underlying biclustering structure. In particular, we
show that a constrained least squares estimator achieves minimax
rate-optimal performance in several of the most important
scenarios. To this end, we derive unified high probability upper
bounds for all sub-Gaussian data and also provide matching
minimax lower bounds in both Gaussian and binary cases. Due to
the close connection of graphon to stochastic block models, an
immediate consequence of our general results is a minimax rate-
optimal estimator for sparse graphons.
