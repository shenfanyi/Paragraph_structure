Government surveys of business establishments receive a large
volume of submissions where a small subset contain errors.
Analysts need a fast-computing algorithm to flag this subset due
to a short time window between collection and reporting. We
offer a computationally-scalable optimization method based on
non-parametric mixtures of hierarchical Dirichlet processes that
allows discovery of multiple industry-indexed local partitions
linked to a set of global cluster centers. Outliers are
nominated as those clusters containing few observations. We
extend an existing approach with a new
