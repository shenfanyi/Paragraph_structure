Classification is an important supervised learning technique
with numerous applications. We develop an angle-based
multicategory distance-weighted support vector machine (MDWSVM)
classification method that is motivated from the binary
distance-weighted support vector machine (DWSVM) classification
method. The new method has the merits of both support vector
machine (SVM) and distance-weighted discrimination (DWD) but
also alleviates both the
