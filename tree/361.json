We derive computationally tractable methods to select a small
subset of experiment settings from a large pool of given design
points. The primary focus is on linear regression models, while
the technique extends to generalized linear models and Delta's
method (estimating functions of linear regression models) as
well. The algorithms are based on a continuous relaxation of an
otherwise intractable combinatorial optimization problem, with
sampling or greedy procedures as post-processing steps. Formal
approximation guarantees are established for both algorithms,
and numerical results on both synthetic and real-world data
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
