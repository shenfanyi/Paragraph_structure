We study the problem of rank aggregation: given a set of ranked
lists, we want to form a consensus ranking. Furthermore, we
consider the case of extreme lists: i.e., only the rank of the
best or worst elements are known. We impute missing ranks and
generalise Spearman's $\rho$ to extreme ranks. Our main
contribution is the derivation of a non-parametric estimator for
rank aggregation based on multivariate extensions of Spearman's
$\rho$, which measures correlation between a set of ranked
lists. Multivariate Spearman's $\rho$ is defined using copulas,
and we show that the geometric mean of normalised ranks
maximises multivariate correlation. Motivated by this, we
propose a weighted geometric mean approach for learning to rank
which has a closed form least squares solution. When only the
best (top-k) or worst (bottom-k) elements of a ranked list are
known, we impute the missing ranks by the average value,
allowing us to apply Spearman's $\rho$. We discuss an optimistic
and pessimistic imputation of missing values, which respectively
maximise and minimise correlation, and show its effect on
aggregating university rankings. Finally, we demonstrate good
performance on the rank aggregation benchmarks MQ2007 and
MQ2008.
