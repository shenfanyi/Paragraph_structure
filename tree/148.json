Learning risk scores to predict dichotomous or continuous
outcomes using machine learning approaches has been studied
extensively. However, how to learn risk scores for time-to-event
outcomes subject to right censoring has received little
attention until recently. Existing approaches rely on inverse
probability weighting or rank-based regression, which may be
inefficient. In this paper, we develop a new support vector
hazards machine (SVHM) approach to predict censored outcomes.
Our method is based on predicting the counting process
associated with the time-to-event outcomes among subjects at
risk via a series of support vector machines. Introducing
counting processes to represent time-to-event data leads to a
connection between support vector machines in supervised
learning and hazards regression in standard survival analysis.
To account for different at risk populations at observed event
times, a time-varying offset is used in estimating risk scores.
The resulting optimization is a convex quadratic programming
problem that can easily incorporate non-linearity using kernel
trick. We demonstrate an interesting link from the profiled
empirical risk function of SVHM to the Cox partial likelihood.
We then formally show that SVHM is optimal in discriminating
covariate-specific hazard function from population average
hazard function, and establish the consistency and learning rate
of the predicted risk using the estimated risk scores.
Simulation studies show improved prediction accuracy of the
event times using SVHM compared to existing machine learning
methods and standard conventional approaches. Finally, we
analyze two real world biomedical study data where we use
clinical markers and neuroimaging biomarkers to predict age-at-
onset of a disease, and demonstrate superiority of SVHM in
distinguishing high risk versus low risk subjects.
