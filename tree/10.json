Multi-label classification has rapidly attracted interest in the
machine learning literature, and there are now a large number
and considerable variety of methods for this type of learning.
We present MEKA: an open-source Java framework based on the
well-known WEKA library. MEKA provides interfaces to facilitate
practical application, and a wealth of multi-label classifiers,
evaluation metrics, and tools for multi-label experiments and
development. It supports multi-label and multi-target data,
including in incremental and semi- supervised contexts.
