Dictionaries are collections of vectors used for the
representation of a class of vectors in Euclidean spaces. Recent
research on optimal dictionaries is focused on constructing
dictionaries that offer sparse representations, i.e.,
$\ell_0$-optimal representations. Here we consider the problem
of finding optimal dictionaries with which representations of a
given class of vectors is optimal in an $\ell_2$-sense:
optimality of representation is defined as attaining the minimal
average $\ell_2$-norm of the coefficients used to represent the
vectors in the given class. With the help of recent results on
rank-1 decompositions of symmetric positive semidefinite
matrices, we provide an explicit description of $\ell_2$-optimal
dictionaries as well as their algorithmic constructions in
polynomial time.
