This paper surveys the state of the art on multimodal gesture
recognition and introduces the JMLR special topic on gesture
recognition 2011-2015. We began right at the start of the
\kinect revolution when inexpensive infrared cameras providing
image depth recordings became available. We published papers
using this technology and other more conventional methods,
including regular video cameras, to record data, thus providing
a good overview of uses of machine learning and computer vision
using multimodal data in this area of application. Notably, we
organized a series of challenges and made available several
datasets we recorded for that purpose, including tens of
thousands of videos, which are available to conduct further
research. We also overview recent state of the art works on
gesture recognition based on a proposed taxonomy for gesture
recognition, discussing challenges and future lines of research.
