As data sets of related studies become more easily accessible,
combining data sets of similar studies is often undertaken in
practice to achieve a larger sample size and higher power. A
major challenge arising from data integration pertains to data
heterogeneity in terms of study population, study design, or
study coordination. Ignoring such heterogeneity in data analysis
may result in biased estimation and misleading inference.
Traditional techniques of remedy to data heterogeneity include
the use of interactions and random effects, which are inferior
to achieving desirable statistical power or providing a
meaningful interpretation, especially when a large number of
smaller data sets are combined. In this paper, we propose a
regularized fusion method that allows us to identify and merge
inter-study homogeneous parameter clusters in regression
analysis, without the use of hypothesis testing approach. Using
the fused lasso, we establish a computationally efficient
procedure to deal with large-scale integrated data.
Incorporating the estimated parameter ordering in the fused
lasso facilitates computing speed with no loss of statistical
power. We conduct extensive simulation studies and provide an
application example to demonstrate the performance of the new
method with a comparison to the conventional methods.
