The rise of Internet-scale networks, such as web graphs and
social media with hundreds of millions to billions of nodes,
presents new scientific opportunities, such as overlapping
community detection to discover the structure of the Internet,
or to analyze trends in online social behavior. However, many
existing probabilistic network models are difficult or
impossible to deploy at these massive scales. We propose a
scalable approach for modeling and inferring latent spaces in
Internet-scale networks, with an eye towards overlapping
community detection as a key application. By applying a succinct
representation of networks as a bag of triangular motifs,
developing a parsimonious statistical model, deriving an
efficient stochastic variational inference algorithm, and
implementing it as a distributed cluster program via the Petuum
parameter server system, we demonstrate overlapping community
detection on real networks with up to 100 million nodes and 1000
communities on 5 machines in under 40 hours. Compared to other
state-of-the-art probabilistic network approaches, our method is
several orders of magnitude faster, with competitive or improved
accuracy at overlapping community detection.
