Training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with algorithms employing
global search strategies has been an important research
direction in the field of neural networks. Despite a number of
significant results, an important matter concerning the bounds
of the search region---typically defined as a box---where a
global optimization method has to search for a potential global
minimizer seems to be unresolved. The approach presented in this
paper builds on interval analysis and attempts to define
guaranteed bounds in the search space prior to applying a global
search algorithm for training an MLP. These bounds depend on the
machine precision and the term
