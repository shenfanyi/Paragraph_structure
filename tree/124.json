In this paper we propose a new algorithm to perform clustering
of multivariate and functional data. We study the case of two
populations different in their covariances, rather than in their
means. The algorithm relies on a proper quantification of
distance between the estimated covariance operators of the
populations, and subdivides data in two groups maximising the
distance between their induced covariances. The naive
implementation of such an algorithm is computationally
forbidding, so we propose a heuristic formulation with a much
lighter complexity and we study its convergence properties,
along with its computational cost. We also propose to use an
enhanced estimator for the estimation of discrete covariances of
functional data, namely a linear shrinkage estimator, in order
to improve the precision of the clustering. We establish the
effectiveness of our algorithm through applications to both
synthetic data and a real data set coming from a biomedical
context, showing also how the use of shrinkage estimation may
lead to substantially better results.
