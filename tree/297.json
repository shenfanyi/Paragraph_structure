We propose a Bayesian approach to regression with a scalar
response on vector and tensor covariates. Vectorization of the
tensor prior to analysis fails to exploit the structure, often
leading to poor estimation and predictive performance. We
introduce a novel class of multiway shrinkage priors for tensor
coefficients in the regression setting and present posterior
consistency results under mild conditions. A computationally
efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed for
posterior computation. Simulation studies illustrate substantial
gains over existing tensor regression methods in terms of
estimation and parameter inference. Our approach is further
illustrated in a neuroimaging application.
