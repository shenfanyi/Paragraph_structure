This paper presents an information theory-driven matching
methodology for making causal inference from observational data.
The paper adopts a “potential outcomes framework” view on
evaluating the strength of cause-effect relationships: the
population-wide average effects of binary treatments are
estimated by comparing two groups of units -- the treated and
untreated (control). To reduce the bias in such treatment effect
estimation, one has to compose a control group in such a way
that across the compared groups of units, treatment is
independent of the units' covariates. This requirement gives
rise to a subset selection / matching problem. This paper
presents the models and algorithms that solve the matching
problem by minimizing the mutual information (MI) between the
covariates and the treatment variable. Such a formulation
becomes tractable thanks to the derived optimality conditions
that tackle the non-linearity of the sample-based MI function.
Computational experiments with mixed integer-programming
formulations and four matching algorithms demonstrate the
utility of MI based matching for causal inference studies. The
algorithmic developments culminate in a matching heuristic that
allows for balancing the compared groups in polynomial (close to
linear) time, thus allowing for treatment effect estimation with
large data sets.
