Graphical models express conditional independence relationships
among variables. Although methods for vector-valued data are
well established, functional data graphical models remain
underdeveloped. By functional data, we refer to data that are
realizations of random functions varying over a continuum (e.g.,
images, signals). We introduce a notion of conditional
independence between random functions, and construct a framework
for Bayesian inference of undirected, decomposable graphs in the
multivariate functional data context. This framework is based on
extending Markov distributions and hyper Markov laws from random
variables to random processes, providing a principled
alternative to naive application of multivariate methods to
discretized functional data. Markov properties facilitate the
composition of likelihoods and priors according to the
decomposition of a graph. Our focus is on Gaussian process
graphical models using orthogonal basis expansions. We propose a
hyper-inverse-Wishart-process prior for the covariance kernels
of the infinite coefficient sequences of the basis expansion,
and establish its existence and uniqueness. We also prove the
strong hyper Markov property and the conjugacy of this prior
under a finite rank condition of the prior kernel parameter.
Stochastic search Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are
developed for posterior inference, assessed through simulations,
and applied to a study of brain activity and alcoholism.
