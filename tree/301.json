Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have led to many state-of-
the-art results spanning through various fields. However, a
clear and profound theoretical understanding of the forward
pass, the core algorithm of CNN, is still lacking. In parallel,
within the wide field of sparse approximation, Convolutional
Sparse Coding (CSC) has gained increasing attention in recent
years. A theoretical study of this model was recently conducted,
establishing it as a reliable and stable alternative to the
commonly practiced patch-based processing. Herein, we propose a
novel multi-layer model, ML-CSC, in which signals are assumed to
emerge from a cascade of CSC layers. This is shown to be tightly
connected to CNN, so much so that the forward pass of the CNN is
in fact the thresholding pursuit serving the ML-CSC model. This
connection brings a fresh view to CNN, as we are able to
attribute to this architecture theoretical claims such as
uniqueness of the representations throughout the network, and
their stable estimation, all guaranteed under simple local
sparsity conditions. Lastly, identifying the weaknesses in the
above pursuit scheme, we propose an alternative to the forward
pass, which is connected to deconvolutional and recurrent
networks, and also has better theoretical guarantees.
